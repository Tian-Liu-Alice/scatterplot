# scatterplot

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of scatterplot is to create a scatterplot which makes the relationship between two variables specified in the input of the function (x and y) visualized.

## Installation

You can install the released version of scatterplot from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Tian-Liu-Alice/scatterplot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(scatterplot)
## basic example code
test <- data.frame(
    x = c(2,4,5,8,10),
    y = c(1,2,3,5,5),
    z = c(1,2,5,7,9))
scatterplot(test, x, y)
scatterplot(test, y, x, "red")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
