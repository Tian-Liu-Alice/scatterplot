<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of scatterplot is to create a scatterplot which makes the relationship between two variables specified in the input of the function (x and y) visualized.

## Installation

You can install the released version of scatterplot from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Tian-Liu-Alice/scatterplot")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(scatterplot)
## basic example code
test <- data.frame(
    x = c(2,4,5,8,10),
    y = c(1,2,3,5,5),
    z = c(1,2,5,7,9))
scatterplot(test, x, y)
scatterplot(test, y, x, "red")
```
